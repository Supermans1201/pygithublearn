 The Android SDK primarily supports Eclipse for development and consequently, all the subprojects in the GnucashMobile folder are Eclipse Android projects. In order to compile the application, you need to import the com_actionbarsherlock and GnucashMobile projects into your eclipse workspace. Then you can just invoke "Run as Android application" from eclipse in order to build and install the application on your Android device.
