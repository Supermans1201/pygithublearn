-## Git and Pull requests
+## Reporting Issues
+* The GitHub issue tracker is used for collecting and managing bugs, feature requests and general development planning.
+* When creating a request, first search to make sure a similar one doesn't already exist in the tracker. 
+* Be as specific as possible when providing descriptions of the problems encountered and what the expected behaviour should be.
+* It is also possible to report issues by creating tickets directly from within the app (in the Help Center)
+
+## Code Contributions
 * Contributions are submitted, reviewed, and accepted using Github pull requests. [Read this article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for some details. We use the _Fork and Pull_ model, as described there.
 * You can maintain your stable installation of GnuCash and test with another installation.

 ## Coding style
 * Do write comments. You don't have to comment every line, but if you come up with something thats a bit complex/weird, just leave a comment. Bear in mind that you will probably leave the project at some point and that other people will read your code. Undocumented huge amounts of code are nearly worthless!
